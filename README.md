Automatic compilation of native libraries for the Signal messenger.

### What it is

This repo is a CI/CD workflow that uses GitHub Actions to automatically compile Signal's rust libraries [zkgroup](https://github.com/signalapp/zkgroup/) and [libsignal-client](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-client/). These libraries are required by the [libsignal-service-java (fork)](https://github.com/Turasa/libsignal-service-java/), which is in turn a dependency of [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/). 

Using signal-cli currently requires compiling them individually for a specific operating system and a processor architecture. This repo aims to simplify the installation by providing the pre-compiled binaries for most of the popular platforms (see [releases](../../releases) and [available platforms](#available-platforms) below). For x86_64 Linux, MacOS and Windows it also packages the compiled files into signal-cli, allowing to download and run it without manually swapping the library files.


### How to use it

##### x86_64 processors
For Linux, MacOS and Windows on x86_64 processors, the binaries are packaged into signal-cli. Simply download a [release](../../releases) for your platform and run it as usual. For instance, for signal-cli v0.8.4.1 on Windows, you only need the file `signal-cli-v0.8.4.1-x86_64-Windows.tar.gz`.

##### Other architectures
For other architectures you will need to incorporate the compiled library files into signal-cli according to the [instructions on its wiki](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/wiki/Provide-native-lib-for-libsignal). For Linux, this amounts to swapping the `.so` files inside the `.jar` archives.
For example, for an ARM64 version of signal-cli v0.8.4.1, download the following files: `signal-cli-v0.8.4.1-x86_64-Linux.tar.gz`, `libsignal_jni.so-v0.8.1-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`, `libzkgroup.so-v0.7.0-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz` and unpack them with `tar -xzf â€¦.tar.gz`. Then execute the following commands:

	zip -uj signal-cli-<SIGNAL_CLI_VER>/lib/signal-client-java-<LIBCLIENT_VER>.jar  libsignal_jni.so
	zip -uj signal-cli-<SIGNAL_CLI_VER>/lib/zkgroup-java-<ZKGROUP_VER>.jar  libzkgroup.so

where substitute `<SIGNAL_CLI_VER>` with `v0.8.4.1`, `<LIBCLIENT_VER>` with `v0.7.0`, and `<ZKGROUP_VER>` with `v0.8.1`.


### How it works

The workflow automatically checks for the new signal-cli releases daily; if one is available, it downloads and builds it, as well as the required versions of the native library dependencies. For linux, mac and windows it also patches signal-cli with the compiled libs.

#### Security

All the published files are compiled automatically by GitHub's CI infrastructure, following the steps in the [workflow file](.github/workflows/main.yaml). This can be verified by the "github-actions released this" line on the release's page (also visible with [GitHub API calls](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#get-the-latest-release)). Additionally, a SHA checksum is printed out during the workflow run for every compiled file.

All this means that you can download and run the published binaries without having to put any trust in this repository: all the actions performed to produce the compiled files are done by GitHub, following the instructions in the workflow file whose source can be freely examined.


### Available platforms

##### Compiled libraries and bundled signal-cli:

- `x86_64-linux-gnu`
	Most desktop linuxes, including the ones with `glibc` older than that of Ubuntu 20.04 (see [signal-cli#643](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/issues/643)). This includes Ubuntu 18.04, Debain 10 and CentOS 7.
- `x86_64-apple-darwin`
	MacOS, Intel 64 bit.
- `x86_64-pc-windows`
	Windows, 64 bit, statically linked (does not rely on the Microsoft Visual Code libraries).

##### Compiled libraries:

- `i686-linux-gnu`
	32 bit Linux.
- `armv7-linux-gnueabihf`
	Raspberry Pi 2; many SoC.
- `aarch64-linux-gnu`
	Raspberry Pi 3,4; Pine A64; many SoC.

Tip: use `uname -m` to get your device's architecture.

Suggestions for additional platforms are welcome - feel free to open an issue!
